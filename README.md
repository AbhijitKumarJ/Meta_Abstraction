# Meta_Abstraction
Meta Abstracting data to utilize emergent patterns.

Hi All, here i have tried to find a structured way to look at problems at various levels of abstraction like extracting out values as variables takes it from concrete level(score 0.0) to basic abstraction level(score 1.0), same way next to structural abstraction then functional them meta and so on. Giving each level a numeric value and ideal expectation against ideal score of that level helps us to abstract and evaluate our abstraction.

Disclaimer: This entire process was a brainstorming of ideas between myself and Claude AI, so you might find some peculiar prompts left out in the docs for your enjoyment :)


Now my target use cases for this:

1. Abstraction questions asked particularly to llms or in general any question in this world to a stage so that if we define a standard framework to solve one problem, it can be applied to nearly all problems with lower abstraction in that particular hierarchy. This mean if we have a solution to a problem at just basic abstraction level, we can apply it to problems created by substituting infinite variations in values abstracted. We can take it further.

2. Infinite questions and answer set for training llms, since with one question you can generate literally infinite questions and answers for lower abstraction level.

3. Planning more advanced system to solve problems at meta and such high level of abstraction which can literally solve/give insights to entire domain problems of certain generic type.


Please refer below and do checkout the docs and visualizations, it will make everything much clearer.

Abstraction Levels:

1. Concrete Level (Level 0)
   - Raw, specific instance of a problem or scenario
   - Contains all original details, names, and values
   - Example: "A jar contains 1 green button, 2 yellow buttons, 4 red buttons, and 8 blue buttons."

2. Basic Abstraction (Level 1)
   - Replaces specific values with variables
   - Maintains original structure and relationships
   - Example: "A jar contains A green buttons, B yellow buttons, C red buttons, and D blue buttons."

3. Structural Abstraction (Level 2)
   - Identifies and abstracts common patterns or structures
   - Generalizes relationships between elements
   - Example: "A container holds items of N different types, with quantities following a geometric progression."

4. Functional Abstraction (Level 3)
   - Focuses on the purpose or function of elements rather than their specific nature
   - Abstracts processes and operations
   - Example: "A system contains multiple categories of elements with defined quantitative relationships."

5. Conceptual Abstraction (Level 4)
   - Extracts core concepts and principles
   - Removes domain-specific details
   - Example: "A finite set of elements with a defined distribution and selection process."

6. Meta-Abstract (Level 5)
   - Creates a framework for defining and manipulating abstract structures
   - Allows for dynamic creation and modification of problem structures
   - Example: "A system for dynamically defining and analyzing quantitative relationships between categorized elements."

7. Universal Abstract (Level 6)
   - Identifies fundamental principles that apply across multiple domains
   - Creates a unified framework for understanding diverse phenomena
   - Example: "A generalized system for modeling and analyzing discrete or continuous distributions in any domain."

8. Philosophical Abstract (Level 7)
   - Explores the fundamental nature of the concepts involved
   - Examines underlying assumptions and implications
   - Example: "An exploration of the nature of probability, categorization, and measurement in defining our understanding of reality."

Now, let's apply these levels to various sample domains to demonstrate their universality:

1. History (French Revolution):
   - L0: "On July 14, 1789, Parisians stormed the Bastille."
   - L4: "A pivotal event marking a significant shift in power dynamics within a society."
   - L7: "An examination of the nature of social contracts and the catalysts for paradigm shifts in governance structures."

2. Biology (Photosynthesis):
   - L0: "Plants use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose and oxygen."
   - L3: "An energy conversion process transforming external inputs into usable resources and byproducts."
   - L6: "A system for modeling energy transformation and resource generation in living systems."

3. Chemistry (Acid-Base Reaction):
   - L0: "HCl reacts with NaOH to form NaCl and H2O."
   - L2: "Acid A reacts with Base B to form Salt C and Water."
   - L5: "A framework for defining and analyzing interactions between complementary chemical entities."

4. Sports (Soccer/Football):
   - L0: "In soccer, 11 players per team try to score goals by kicking a ball into the opponent's net."
   - L3: "A competitive activity where two groups contend to achieve a specific objective within defined constraints."
   - L7: "An exploration of goal-oriented collective behavior and strategic decision-making under pressure."

5. Art (Impressionist Painting):
   - L0: "Monet's 'Water Lilies' uses small, visible brushstrokes to depict light and color in nature."
   - L4: "A method of representation that prioritizes subjective perception over objective reality."
   - L6: "A system for analyzing and generating representations that balance sensory input, cognitive processing, and expressive output."

6. Philosophy (Epistemology):
   - L0: "Descartes' statement: 'I think, therefore I am.'"
   - L5: "A framework for examining the nature and limits of knowledge and belief."
   - L7: "An inquiry into the fundamental nature of existence, consciousness, and the relationship between mind and reality."



The ability to abstract these diverse problems to higher levels allows us to:
1. Identify common patterns across different domains
2. Apply solutions from one field to problems in another
3. Develop more flexible and adaptable problem-solving strategies
4. Create meta-frameworks for addressing entire classes of problems
5. Gain deeper insights into the fundamental nature of the challenges we face in various aspects of life and work

This comprehensive approach to abstraction and problem-solving can lead to more creative solutions and a deeper understanding of the interconnected nature of knowledge across different fields.
