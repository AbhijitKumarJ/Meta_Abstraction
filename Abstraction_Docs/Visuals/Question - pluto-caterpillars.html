                    • A line of 5 mauve caterpillars is as long as a line of 7 violet caterpillars.
                    • A line of 3 lavender caterpillars and 1 mauve caterpillar is as long as a line of 8 violet caterpillars.
                    • A line of 5 lavender caterpillars, 5 mauve caterpillars and 2 violet caterpillars is 1m long in total.
                    • A lavender caterpillar takes 10 s to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar.
                    • Violet and mauve caterpillars both crawl twice as fast as lavender caterpillars.
