based on the knowledge base can we finalize a list of stages at which  question is with respect to the level of abstraction applied to it like is it at meta abstract level or advanced abstract level or concrete level or basic abstraction level. We can give number to each such level for the level of abstraction , also we need to define what kind of info gets abstracted at that level. Consider yourself the best data analyst and scientist in the world who is familiar with all forms of knowledge. Now let us create one or more final list of abstraction levels with sample as you deem fit. Think and analyze carefully to encompass problems that have not been covered in knowledgebase related to history, philosophy, biology, chemistry, sports, art and any and all category of questions.

Thank you for this intriguing challenge. As an expert data analyst and scientist, I'll create a comprehensive list of abstraction levels that can be applied across a wide range of domains. This list will aim to encompass problems from various fields, including those not explicitly covered in the knowledge base.

Abstraction Levels:

1. Concrete Level (Level 0)
   - Raw, specific instance of a problem or scenario
   - Contains all original details, names, and values
   - Example: "A jar contains 1 green button, 2 yellow buttons, 4 red buttons, and 8 blue buttons."

2. Basic Abstraction (Level 1)
   - Replaces specific values with variables
   - Maintains original structure and relationships
   - Example: "A jar contains A green buttons, B yellow buttons, C red buttons, and D blue buttons."

3. Structural Abstraction (Level 2)
   - Identifies and abstracts common patterns or structures
   - Generalizes relationships between elements
   - Example: "A container holds items of N different types, with quantities following a geometric progression."

4. Functional Abstraction (Level 3)
   - Focuses on the purpose or function of elements rather than their specific nature
   - Abstracts processes and operations
   - Example: "A system contains multiple categories of elements with defined quantitative relationships."

5. Conceptual Abstraction (Level 4)
   - Extracts core concepts and principles
   - Removes domain-specific details
   - Example: "A finite set of elements with a defined distribution and selection process."

6. Meta-Abstract (Level 5)
   - Creates a framework for defining and manipulating abstract structures
   - Allows for dynamic creation and modification of problem structures
   - Example: "A system for dynamically defining and analyzing quantitative relationships between categorized elements."

7. Universal Abstract (Level 6)
   - Identifies fundamental principles that apply across multiple domains
   - Creates a unified framework for understanding diverse phenomena
   - Example: "A generalized system for modeling and analyzing discrete or continuous distributions in any domain."

8. Philosophical Abstract (Level 7)
   - Explores the fundamental nature of the concepts involved
   - Examines underlying assumptions and implications
   - Example: "An exploration of the nature of probability, categorization, and measurement in defining our understanding of reality."

The higher levels of abstraction facilitate the creation of meta-systems that can generate, analyze, and solve a wide range of problems across diverse fields of knowledge.
